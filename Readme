Bolo Seva – Smart Gaav Complaint & Road Safety AI Portal is an innovative, voice-powered digital governance platform tailored to empower rural communities through accessible complaint reporting and AI-driven road safety management. The system leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP), speech-to-text conversion, geolocation intelligence, and computer vision to bridge the digital divide between rural citizens and public authorities.

The core objective is to allow rural residents—even those with low digital literacy—to lodge complaints related to infrastructure, water, electricity, and sanitation simply by speaking in their native language. The voice input is processed using multilingual speech recognition, converted to structured data using NLP, and then geo-tagged before being routed to the relevant authorities via an integrated notification system. Simultaneously, the platform uses AI-based hazard detection models, deployed via mobile and fixed cameras, to identify road anomalies like potholes, blocked drains, or broken signage in real-time using image classification and edge detection techniques.

A real-time public dashboard ensures transparency and accountability by displaying complaint statuses, safety alerts, and response timelines. The system is designed to function both online and in semi-offline modes, with local caching to ensure uninterrupted reporting in areas with limited connectivity.

Example: Suppose a villager sees a broken transformer sparking dangerously near a school. Instead of navigating complex portals, they simply open the Bolo Seva app or dial a helpline and say, “Gaav ke school ke paas transformer tut gaya hai aur aag nikal rahi hai.” The system instantly transcribes the message, identifies the emergency nature, tags the exact location using GPS, categorizes the complaint as “electrical hazard,” and triggers a red-flag alert to the nearby electricity board and Gram Panchayat officials. Meanwhile, a map-based visual on the dashboard marks the incident for public and administrative awareness.

The project architecture follows a microservices-based backend with secure REST APIs, scalable cloud deployment, and Firebase or MongoDB for complaint data handling. For road safety, pre-trained deep learning models such as YOLOv5 or EfficientNet are used for real-time video analysis.

In essence, Bolo Seva is not just a portal—it is a step toward creating voice-empowered smart villages, integrating AI, accessibility, and accountability to bring the benefits of digital governance to the grassroots.
